The provided code demonstrates the usage of OpenCV and matplotlib to generate marker images and visualize a Charuco board. It also captures a series of images of the board using a webcam.

The code starts by installing the necessary package, opencv-contrib-python, and importing the required libraries.

A function named generate_marker_image is defined to create a marker image based on a dictionary, marker ID, and size.

The code then specifies a dictionary and sets a marker ID and size to generate a marker image. The image is saved and visualized.

A Charuco board is created with specified parameters, and its image is generated and saved. It is then converted to the BGR color space and visualized.

A webcam is initialized, and a loop captures a series of frames from the camera. Each frame is converted and displayed.

Overall, the code showcases marker image generation, visualization, Charuco board creation, and webcam image capture.
